## About

I built this app to use during an R Shiny workshop for graduate student researchers. The workshop introduces students to a variety of Shiny concepts and features.


## Learning Objectives

The learning objectives for the workshop include:

-   **UI layout and theme:** Using a navigation bar, sidebar, layout columns, tooltips, and card components

-   **Input Widgets:** Uploading data files and user selections

-   **Reactive programming:** Observing events and dynamic updates

-   **Data analysis:** Using `dplyr` functions for cleaning and summarizing

-   **Visualization:** Creating interactive plots with `ggplot2` and `plotly`

-   **File Download:** Using `downloadHandler` to allow users download the processed data
