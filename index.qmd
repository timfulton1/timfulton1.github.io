Hi, I'm Tim. Welcome to my website!

After earning my PhD and studying the physiological factors that impact human performance across the adult lifespan, I transitioned to a career in data science. Much of what I learned as a researcher transferred smoothly to the data world - the scientific method and the data science life cycle are very similar!

I enjoy exploring data to find patterns, creating visualizations that tell compelling stories, and writing reports that answer business and research questions. I also develop tools that allow others to efficiently analyze their own data and like teaching data science skills that empower people to complete their own data projects.

Throughout the site you will find examples of my work, including data visualizations, Shiny applications, and written reports. Please message me on LinkedIn with any questions or if you'd like to connect.

Thanks for visiting!
