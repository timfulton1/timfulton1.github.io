Hi, I'm Tim. Welcome to my website!

After earning my PhD and studying the physiological factors that impact human performance across the lifespan, I transitioned to a career in data science - the scientific method and the data science life cycle are very similar!

I enjoy creating visualizations and reports that tell compelling stories and help people better understand data. I also develop tools that allow others to efficiently analyze their own data and am passionate about teaching data science skills that empower people to complete their own data projects.

Throughout the site you will find examples of my work, including data visualizations, Shiny applications, and written reports. I hope to add tutorials soon! Please message me on LinkedIn with any questions or if you'd like to connect.

Thanks for visiting!
