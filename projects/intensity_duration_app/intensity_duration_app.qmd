## About

I built this app to make it easy for athletes to determine their critical power or critical speed.


## Physiological Background

The sustainable duration of exercise is dependent upon the intensity (i.e., power or speed) at which the exercise is performed. This fundamental concept is known as the intensity-duration relationship, and for exercise durations of ~2â€“40 minutes, can be modeled by a two-parameter hyperbolic equation (see methods below). The critical intensity (power or speed) is the highest intensity that can be sustained primarily by aerobic metabolism while still achieving a metabolic steady state. The critical intensity is also a metabolic threshold such that exercising at intensities (powers or speeds) above the threshold will cause increased reliance on anaerobic metabolism and a greater accumulation of fatigue-inducing metabolites. For a given intensity above the threshold, the time until task failure is dependent on the magnitude of the curvature constant (W' or D'), suggesting that curvature constant can be viewed as a fatigue buffer (or fatigue constant). 


## Methods

#### Cycling
The data are fit using a two parameter hyperbolic model according to the equation below:

$$
t = \frac{W'}{P - CP} \
$$

where ***t*** is the performance time (s), ***W'*** is the curvature constant (Joules), ***P*** is the performance power (W), and ***CP*** is the Critical Power (W). 

Two additional variables that are calculated in the application are:

1. **5 minute Power** - An estimate of the highest power that can be sustained for 5 minutes.
2. **20 minute Power** - An estimate of the highest power that can be sustained for 20 minutes.


#### Running
The data are fit using a two parameter hyperbolic model according to the equation below:

$$
t = \frac{D'}{S - CS} \
$$

where ***t*** is the performance time (s), ***D'*** is the curvature constant (m), ***S*** is the average speed (m/s), and ***CS*** is the critical speed (m/s).

Two additional variables that are calculated in the application are:

1. **Mile** - Estimated one mile performance.
2. **5,000 m** - Estimated 5K performance.
